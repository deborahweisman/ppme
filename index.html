A comprehensive compilation of Plant Pests of the Middle East (PPME)
is long overdue. <br>
Agriculture in the Middle East has much in common
with agriculture in many other parts of the world, but with many
distinct characteristics. The same can be said for pests in this
region. Some have originated or are found in other parts of the world,
while others are endemic to the Middle East. Considerable information
of the different pest species, their relative importance, and on
measures taken to control them, has accumulated in this region, with
agriculture intensifying and changing its focus. The agricultural
community must comply with environmental considerations and still
maintain a proper balance between crop production and the economics of
control. Understanding pest-pest and pest-plant interactions in the
agro-ecosystems of the Middle East and their effects on specific
crops, is essential for maintaining good agricultural practice and
balancing between the needs of the agricultural community and demands
of the general public, from the economic as well as the environmental
points of view.
</p><p>
Accessibility of information is a major concern: Published books and
scientific journals are costly whereas unpublished reports are usually
unavailable. Information printed in books is often outdated almost
from the time of publication and is not updated until new editions
appear, if at all. Commercial considerations of publishing, such as
the costs of color photographs and graphic art, limit their
incorporation into conventional books. These reservations do not apply
to this online "virtual" publication. If you are interested in being
listed in our registry (at no cost), would like to be a contributor,
or would just like to know more about us please contact us.
</p>

 
<p>
The two co-editors are from the Department of Entomology, Faculty of
Agricultural, Food and Environmental Quality Sciences of the Hebrew
University, located in Rehovot, Israel, and both have equally
contributed to this compilation. The most convenient way to contact us
is by e-mail:
</p>

<p>
Uri Gerson (<a href="mailto:uri.gerson@mail.huji.ac.il">uri.gerson@mail.huji.ac.il</a>).
</p>
<p>
Scientific activities of the co-editors can be found in their
institutional websites.

PPME contains invited chapters and items. It is intended for the
undergraduate student in agriculture, for the postgraduate student or
researcher in plant protection, but is also suitable for extension
workers, informed farmers and non-professional readers who are
interested in the subject. To assist the reader, "highlighted" terms
and concepts are summarized in the glossary.
</p><p>
Due to the use of different vernacular names that are applied to the
various pests and natural enemies that are covered in PPME, the Index
is arranged according to the scientific names of these arthropods, but
their more common names are included whenever appropriate.
</p><p>
We envision PPME as being an "open-ended" text, with chapters to be
placed on the internet site after being reviewed, accepted and edited.
These chapters will be modified and updated if and when new
information becomes available: The composing and editing of PPME is an
ongoing process.
</p><p>
This project could not have been accomplished without the
encouragement and support of present and past Rectors of the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem and the present and past Deans of the Faculty
of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences at Rehovot, Israel.
In addition, we acknowledge the help and support offered us by many
colleagues; we especially recognize Drs. Y. Argov,  and Y. Gazit, and
Mr. Y. Drishpoun for providing us with original photogtaphs of many
pests and natural enemies. Finally we wish to express our deep
appreciation to Mrs. D. Weisman of the Computer Center at Rehovot, for
the unstinting assistance that she has given us throughout.
